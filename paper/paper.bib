abstract = {An overview of grid-based numerical methods used in relativistic hydrodynamics (RHD) and magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is presented. Special emphasis is put on a comprehensive review of the application of high-resolution shock-capturing methods. Results of a set of demanding test bench simulations obtained with different numerical methods are compared in an attempt to assess the present capabilities and limits of the various numerical strategies. Applications to three astrophysical phenomena are briefly discussed to motivate the need for and to demonstrate the success of RHD and RMHD simulations in their understanding. The review further provides FORTRAN programs to compute the exact solution of the Riemann problem in RMHD, and to simulate 1D RMHD flows in Cartesian coordinates.},

@article{Zhang1989,
abstract = {The Riemann problem for gasdynamic combustion is considered. Existence and uniqueness are obtained constructively for arbitrary Riemann data under the following restrictions: the solutions are selfsimilar and piecewise smooth; the Lax entropy condition is satisfied at the discontinuity points except at the front sides of deflagration waves where the temperatures are assumed to be ignition point; the number of detonation waves in the solutions is as small as possible; the number of times of oscillation of temperature around the ignition point is also as small as possible; and last, the number of deflagration waves is as large as possible. Using the Riemann problem, we analyzed the overtaking of shocks and combustion waves: a shock always accelerates detonation, whereas it transforms deflagration into detonation when it is strong enough. Transition from deflagration to detonation in the ignition problem is also investigated.},

@article{Rezzolla2002,
abstract = {In Newtonian and relativistic hydrodynamics the Riemann problem determines the evolution of a fluid which is initially characterized by two states having different rest-mass density, pressure, and velocity. When the fluid is allowed to relax, one of three possible wave patterns is produced, corresponding to the propagation in opposite directions of two nonlinear hydrodynamical waves. New effects emerge in a relativistic Riemann problem when velocities tangential to the initial discontinuity are present. A smooth transition from one wave pattern to another can be produced by varying the initial tangential velocities while maintaining the initial states unmodified. These special relativistic effects are produced by the Lorentz factors and do not have a Newtonian counterpart.},
