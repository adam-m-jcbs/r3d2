    "# Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the Riemann problem is built out of *waves*. These are regions where the variables change, separating constant states. There are two basic types of wave: those across which the variables change continuously (which, for fluid problems, are known as *rarefactions*), and those across which the variables change discontinuously (which break down into more subclasses).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the state is known on one side of the wave, which will be denoted ${\\bf U}_k$. The state on the other side will be unknown. Given the value of one variable, typically the pressure $p$, on the unknown side, the solution across the wave can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations here are adapted from the [Living Review of Martí and Müller](http://computastrophys.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrca-2015-3/articlese8.html#x11-1150008.5). The approach to reactive waves follows the [paper of Zhang and Zheng][1], extended to the Relativistic case.\n",

    "## Wave sections\n",
    "\n",
    "In general any wave can be built from multiple sections, pieced together. A wave may \"split\" into two discontinuous pieces moving at different speeds. A wave may contain a discontinuous section attached to a continuous section. In the most complex cases, the wave may have an arbitrarily large number of sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the inert case, and when the equation of state is convex, each wave contains a single section. If the pressure decreases across the wave, $p_k > p$, then the wave is a continuous rarefaction. If the pressure increases across the wave, $p_k < p$, then the wave is a discontinuous shock. If the pressure does not change, the wave is either trivial (the state does not change) or a contact discontinuity (where quantities except $p$ and $v_x$ may jump).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reactive case, all the reactions that we can model will take place \"instantly\". This means that reactions must take place across discontinuous wave sections. The reactive waves may now contain multiple wave sections. If the equation of state is convex, and the reaction exothermic, then across a reactive discontinuous wave the pressure increases. Therefore if the pressure is to decrease across the wave as a whole, there must be an inert *precursor* shock before the reactive discontinuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we note that not all reactive discontinuous waves are stable. This can be checked by looking at the wave speed on the unknown side of the wave. If the wave speed leads to characteristics coming *out* of the discontinuity, then the wave is unstable. In this case we need to add another wave section. We find the fastest stable reactive discontinuity (a *Chapman-Jouget* discontinuity), where the wave speed matches the speed of the discontinuity, and attach to it an inert rarefaction."

In general, detonations fall into two classes: *weak* detonations (which are unstable) and *strong* detonations (which are stable).

For the unstable weak detonations the characteristics only enter the discontinuity on one side.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an unstable weak detonation is found, the section should be replaced by the fastest detonation that is stable. This Chapman-Jouget, or CJ detonation, is where the characteristic wave is parallel to the discontinuity.

    "## Deflagration\n",

    "A deflagration is a discontinuous wave section across which the pressure decreases. As a reaction cannot take place across a rarefaction wave, this requires a discontinuity. However, this discontinuity will reduce the temperature along with the pressure. This means that, unless the material was already at the right temperature to react, any reaction across this wave would be unphysical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to start with an inert *precursor* shock which raises the temperature of the material to the ignition temperature. This first section follows the exact equations in the shock section above. Next, there is a deflagration wave section, across which the reaction takes place and the pressure drops. Again, this follows the shock equations, but with the same interpretation as in the detonation case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the deflagration wave section need not be stable. As with detonations, deflagrations fall into two classes: *weak* deflagrations (which are stable), and *strong* deflagrations (which are unstable). For the stable weak deflagrations the characteristic waves from one side impinge on the discontinuity, but not the other. For the unstable strong deflagrations, neither set of characteristic waves impinges on the discontinuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if an unstable strong deflagration is found it is replaced with a CJ deflagration, and the full wave is completed with a rarefaction wave section."
